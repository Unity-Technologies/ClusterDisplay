# Cluster Display overview

The Unity Cluster Display solution allows multiple machines to display the same Unity Scene synchronously through display clustering (large, multi-display configurations).

## Prerequisites

* Unity 2020.1 or higher.
* Unity 2020.2 or higher if using DX12 and Swap Barriers.

When installing add **Windows Build Support (IL2CPP)**.

If using **Swap Barriers**:

* Only supported on Windows Vista and higher.
* Only supported on DirectX 11 or DirectX 12.
* Requires an [NVIDIA Quadro GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/quadro/).
* Requires one or more [NVIDIA Quadro Sync II](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/solutions/quadro-sync/) boards.

### Hardware
Required hardware is detailed in the [Cluster Display documentation](source/com.unity.cluster-display/Documentation~/index.md) in the 

## Contents

This repository contains in-development packages, tests and test projects, as well as files for building the NvAPI plugin for Swap Barrier support.

| TestProjects/QuadroSyncTest | Test project to validate NVIDIA Swap Barrier support. |

## Installation

The Cluster Display packages are currently experimental and must be installed manually. [See the documentation for installing a package from a local folder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-local.html).

It is recommended to use [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for development.

### NVIDIA Quadro Sync Swap Barrier support

NVIDIA's NvAPI provides the capability to synchronize the buffer swaps of a group of DirectX swap chains when using Quadro Sync II boards. This extension also provides the capability to synchronize the buffer swaps of different swaps groups, which may reside on distributed systems on a network using a swap barrier. Itâ€™s essential to coordinate the back buffer swap between nodes, so it can stay perfectly synchronized (Frame Lock + Genlock) for a large number of displays.

See [GfxPluginQuadroSyncCallbacks.cs](source/com.unity.cluster-display/Runtime/QuadroSync/GfxPluginQuadroSyncCallbacks.cs) for example usage.
