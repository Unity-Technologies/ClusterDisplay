      description: Sets the launch configuration of the current mission.  Although all LaunchComplexes and LaunchPads referenced by the LaunchConfiguration should exist, this is not a hard requirement as the mapping gets resolved when preparing the launch skipping missing elements.  This is especially useful for loading a saved mission referencing LaunchComplexes or LaunchPads that have been deleted and are added back before the launch.  The same idea applies to LaunchParameterValue of the launch configuration, nothing is validated against the asset constraints until we launch (at which point only parameters with valid values are passed to the launchpads).

Setting it twice in quick succession before the effective value is updated will cause the command to be executed only once.  A null effective value indicate that the command was never ran.
