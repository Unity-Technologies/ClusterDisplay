  title: Mission Control - LaunchPad API
  description: |-
    This is the API to control a Mission Control LaunchPad.  Since one of the requirements is to be able to avoid having to run an update on each individual computer part of the Mission Control manually and to be able to run older Cluster Display executables, we decided to go toward a minimalist Launch Pad that does the strict minimum and delegate as much as possible to components it manages.  The most reliable update is the update we do not need to do!  Still, there is a planned mechanism for updates, but if everything goes according to plan, updates should be really rare.
