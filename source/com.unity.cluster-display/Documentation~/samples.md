# Cluster Display Samples
We've provided a set of sample projects to demonstrate how you may use Cluster Display in your own projects, the samples include:

## How to Test

We've provided a UI that automatically enumerates the various sample projects:

![Scene Composition Manager](images/scene-composition-manager.png)

There are two methods you can use to test:
1. Open the scenes from two separate instances of the Unity editor to play.
2. Stage the scenes and build from one instance of the Unity editor and start two instances of the resulting executable.

### Setup for Testing in the Editor

### Setup for Testing from Build

## Audio Reactive
This sample propagate the audio spectrum from a audio input device for visualization across the cluster display.

## Micro FPS
Sample that uses Unity's [MicroFPS sample](https://learn.unity.com/project/fps-template) to demonstrate gameplay across the cluster display.

## Fish
This sample demonstrates how you can implement a custom determinsitic physics based particle system using DOTS. In this case you can add fish to a boid system and feed them food.
